I see the issue now. Looking at your code structure, I can see that while you have an `evaluators` table and JSON data with evaluator records, you're missing the API endpoint that would serve this data to your frontend.

Here's what I need to do:

1. Create an API endpoint for evaluators
2. Connect it to your existing storage implementation
3. Update your routes to include this endpoint

Let's implement these changes:

Now, let's create or update the routes/index.ts file to include the evaluators router:



Let's also add some debugging code to your welcome.tsx file to better understand what's happening with the evaluators data:



## Implementation Plan

Based on the code I've provided, here's what you need to do to fix the evaluator dropdown:

1. **Create the routes directory** if it doesn't already exist in your project.

2. **Add the evaluators.ts route file** to that directory with the code I provided.

3. **Create or update the index.ts file** in your routes directory to include the evaluators router.

4. **Update your welcome.tsx file** with the improved query code I provided to add better error handling and debug information.

5. **Restart your server** after making these changes to ensure the new routes are registered.

## How This Solution Works

1. **Storage Layer**: Your `storage.ts` already has the necessary methods to interact with evaluators in the database:
   - `getAllEvaluators()` - which we'll use for the dropdown
   - `getEvaluator(id)` - for fetching a specific evaluator

2. **API Routes**: The new files I've provided create the missing API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/evaluators` - Returns all evaluators from the database
   - `GET /api/evaluators/:id` - Returns a specific evaluator by ID

3. **Frontend Updates**: The improved query implementation in your welcome.tsx will:
   - Add proper error handling
   - Provide better loading state indicators
   - Log debug information to help you troubleshoot

## Additional Tips

1. **Check your browser's network tab** to see if the /api/evaluators request is being made and what response you're getting.

2. **Check your server console** for any errors related to the evaluators endpoint.

3. **Database Population**: If you're seeing an empty array being returned (rather than an error), you might need to seed your evaluators table with data. You can use your evaluators.json file for this.

4. **Data Format**: Make sure your frontend code is expecting the same data structure that your backend is returning.

By implementing these changes, your evaluator dropdown should properly display the evaluators from your database instead of showing "No evaluators found."
