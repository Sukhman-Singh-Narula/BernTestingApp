I can see from the new logs that while our options object approach was implemented in `openai.ts`, we're still seeing issues with how the function is being called. Looking at the logs, I can identify the exact problem:

# Problem Analysis

In `conversationRoutes.ts`, the `generateResponse` function is still being called with positional parameters instead of the new options object:

```javascript
const aiResponse = await generateResponse(
  "start",
  initialStep,
  "",
  conversationId
);
```

But the function now expects an options object:

```javascript
// From the logs
Generating response for conversation undefined {
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant',
  userInput: undefined,
  messagesCount: 2
}
```

Notice that `userInput` is undefined because the wrong parameter style is being used. The OpenAI logs show that the system prompt defaults to "You are a helpful assistant" instead of using the activity-specific system prompt.

# Solution

We need to update the function calls in `conversationRoutes.ts` to use the new options object pattern:

```javascript
// In conversationRoutes.ts - where initial response is generated
const conversationWithPrompt = await storage.getConversationWithSystemPrompt(conversation.id);
const systemPromptText = conversationWithPrompt?.systemPrompt?.systemPrompt || "";
const choiceLayerPromptText = conversationWithPrompt?.choiceLayerPrompt?.systemPrompt || "";

const aiResponse = await generateResponse({
  userInput: "start",
  step: initialStep,
  previousMessages: [],
  choiceLayerPrompt: choiceLayerPromptText,
  activitySystemPrompt: systemPromptText,
  conversationId: conversation.id
});
```

# Implementation Steps

1. Find all locations in the codebase where `generateResponse` is called (there should be at least two in `conversationRoutes.ts`):
   - When creating a new conversation
   - When retrieving a conversation that has no messages

2. Update each call to use the options object pattern

3. Ensure we're properly retrieving both the system prompt and choice layer prompt before calling the function

This approach will ensure that the proper prompts are passed to the OpenAI API, fixing the problem where the system prompt wasn't being used.
